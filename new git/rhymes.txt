Bow-wow, says the dog,
mew, mew, says the cat,
Grund, grund, goes the hog,
And squeak goes the rat.
Tu-whu, says the owl,
Caw, caw, says the crow,
Quack, quack, says the duck,
And what cuckoos say you know.

To The Snail
Snail, snail, put out your horns,
And I'll give you bread
      and barly-corns.


To the lady-Birds
Lady-bird, lady-bird,
Fly away home,
Your house is on fire
   And your children all gone;
All exept one
   And that's little Ann
And she has crept under
   The warming pan.
