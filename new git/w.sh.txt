W.Shakespear was born on April23, 1564 in Strasford - upon Avon.
His father was a glove-maker. William went to a grammar school 
and had a good education. There he learned to love reading.
 William married when he was still a teenager. His wife, Anne Hatha-
way , was several years older than him. He cavred his living helping
his fathers business . William had three children when he left for Lon-
don in 1587. Some people say that the reason he left his wife and children
was his love to poetry and theatre.
In London Shakespeare began to act and to write plays and soon became an
important member of a well-known acting company. Most of his plays were
performed in the Globe Theatre, built on the River Thames. In 1613 he 
stopped writing and went back to live in Stratford where he died in 1616.
